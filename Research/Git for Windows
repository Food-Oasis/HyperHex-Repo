This packages with three tools: Git Bash, Git GUI, and Shell Integration.

-As for this project, we will be using Git bash to clone the repository into a folder, so whatever commits we make to
the android studio application it will be updated to the file, as long as we clone it. Feel free to look into it when you get the chance.
Git Bash will make a lot of things easier for us this way we can all be on the same page.
